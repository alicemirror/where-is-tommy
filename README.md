# Tales for Makers - Where is Tommy?
## Project: parking meter remake

The project is made with different tecnologies:

### ----- Nicla Sense ME board
###             |
###         Python script
###             |
###         Node.js server
###             |
###         React app

At the root we have a Nicla Sense ME firmware to create the motion gestures sensor. Sensor data
are integrated to the required range of values and converted in a Json 
string. The string is sent to the host via the USB-Serial interface and sent via HTTP to a
Node.js server endpoint.

This App.js is the main React file, which fetches the /api endpoint from the Node.js server and populates the "state" of the app.

## Node.js server start
In the api folder, you can run:
### `npm install`
This will install all the dependencies.
Than you can run:

### `npm start`

The server will be working on [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000).
The endpoint used in this project is [/api](http://localhost/9000/api), so you can test it with Postman or Curl.

## Client Available Scripts

In the client directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
